# AIChatbar
Get your favorite AI Chat websites in the sidebar of your Windows OS similar to Windows Copilot but also adds ChatGPT, Bard, Hugging Chat, Bing Chat, etc.

You can add as many AI Chat sites, but not limited only to those sites.

You can invoke them by using your custom global hotkey, so it will be in fron of your finger tips at one hotkey, ready to ask/answer.

For instance, by default it is set to `Win`+`F12` hotkey, hitting that hotkey if you have any AI Chat website open, it will be shown there.
